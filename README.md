</ul>

## Features
<ul>
  <li>
    Performs operators:
    <ol>
      <li>Addition "+" </li>
      <li>Substraction "-" </li>
      <li>Modulo "%" </li>
      <li>Pow "X^" </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Display an operation's result on the screen </li>
  <li>Clean the screen when "C" is clicked </li>
</ul>

## Outcome
Throughout this project, I utilized some modern css like flexbox and transition to annimate buttons, I played with the DOM, done some refactoring and used notion of callback
to increase my code readibility. For example instead of having to check each operator with conditions or switch, I just pass the function to ``` operate(num1, num2, operatorFunction)```
